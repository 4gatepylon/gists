Just a practice "test" to see how fast I can work on Leetcode Mediums.

This was relatively easy, but I was much slower than I had hoped. Took me around 3-3:30 hours to
finish around 8 problems. I had originally hoped to finish around 15 problems in 3 hours at
15 minutes per problem. Most of my slowdowns came from debugging. I blame it on mostly just
being tired because I have not been getting great sleep. I think in the future it will be important
to make sure my basic life shit is going OK.

The problems I did not get to solve in time are:
- https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-area-rectangle-ii/ 
- https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-random-point-in-a-circle/
- https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-square/
- https://leetcode.com/problems/mirror-reflection/ 
- https://leetcode.com/problems/queries-on-number-of-points-inside-a-circle/
- https://leetcode.com/problems/detonate-the-maximum-bombs/ 
- https://leetcode.com/problems/count-lattice-points-inside-a-circle/

I'm going to aim to do them in 2 hours 20 (these are slightly harder problems, I think), giving myself up to
20 minutes per problem (there are 7 in total) for the next batch. I'm doing these little "tests" to make sure
that I'm solid not only on knowing how to solve/having intuition, but also on actually executing.

In the future I'd like to do some Codeforces/CP and I think this will be useful. Next time I'd like to
implement these in a different language (i.e. Rust).
