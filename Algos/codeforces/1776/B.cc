// All bricks at 2x2x1 (i.e. in projection land they are 2 wide and 1 tall)
// At worst each purple brick can use one brick, meaning that at best we have at most h*n bricks
// We can do better by branching out optimally...
// It is, however, not always better to branch.

// Imagine two bricks a distance d away from each other on x
